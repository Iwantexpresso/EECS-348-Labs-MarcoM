some info on the common racoon dogs from wikipidea 
The common raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), also called the Chinese or Asian raccoon dog to distinguish 
it from the Japanese raccoon dog, is a small, heavy-set, fox-like canid native to East Asia. Named for its 
raccoon-like face markings, it is most closely related to foxes. Common raccoon dogs feed on many animals and 
plant matter, and are unusual among canids (dogs, foxes, and other members of the family Canidae) in that they 
hibernate during cold winters and can climb trees. They are widespread in their native range, and are invasive 
in Europe where they were introduced for the fur trade. The similar Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes viverrinus, 
the tanuki), native to Japan, is the only other living member of the genus Nyctereutes.[2] Other names for the 
common raccoon dog include mangut (its Evenki name),[3] and neoguri (its Korean name).
